</p><h3>Non-Programming Problems:</h3>

Exercise numbers refer to the course textbook, <i>Operating
System Concepts Essentials</i>. Each problem is worth 5 points.
<P>
<OL>
<P><LI>Exercise 1.8

<P><LI>Exercise 2.13

<P><LI>Exercise 2.21

<P><LI>Exercise 2.25

<P><LI>Exercise 2.26

<P><LI>If a Unix program creates a new process by calling fork, can a
    bug in the child process, such as a bad array reference, damage
    the parent process?  Explain.

<P><LI>The example below shows using lseek to print the contents of a
    file backwards:
<pre>
fd = open("textfile", O_RDONLY);
fptr = lseek(fd, (off_t)-1, SEEK_END);
while (fptr != -1) {
        read(fd, buf, 1);
        write(1, buf, 1);
        fptr = lseek(fd, (off_t)-1, SEEK_CUR);
}
</pre>
Explain why it is not a good technique for doing so.  Present a
program that does it better.

<P><LI>Consider the various definitions of an operating system.
Consider whether the operating system should include functionality such
as web browsers and window systems.  Argue both that it should and that
it should not, and support your answer.
</OL>
<P>

</p><h3>Programming Problems:</h3>

For all programming problems you will be required to submit 
source code, a README file documenting your files and code, 
and a test run of your programs.  The README should explain any way in
which your solution differs from what was assigned, and any
assumptions you made.  Refer to the homework submission page on the
class web site for additional submission instructions.
<p>
You should make sure your programs compile and run using the VMware
virtual appliance used for this class.  Information on downloading and
using the appliance is listed in the intro section of the class
in <a href="http://courseworks.columbia.edu">Courseworks</a>.

Simple Shell (60 Pts.)
The shell itself is just another user program. The
      files <KBD>/bin/sh</KBD>, <KBD>/bin/bash</KBD>, and
      <KBD>/bin/tcsh</KBD> are all executable files for shells. The
      only thing special about your login shell is that it is listed
      in your login record so that <KBD>/bin/login</KBD> (the program
      that prompts you for your password) knows what program to start
      when you log in. If you run ``<KBD>ypmatch <VAR>id</VAR>
      passwd</KBD>'', replacing <VAR>id</VAR> with your user ID,
      you'll see your login record, with your login shell program
      listed as the last field.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
	<P>Write a simple shell in C. Your shell should read a
	  line from standard input, parse the line to get the command
	  and its arguments, <CODE>fork</CODE>, and <CODE>exec</CODE>
	  the command. Your shell should wait for commands to finish,
	  and should exit when it receives the command
	  <KBD>exit</KBD>.

	  </P>
	<UL>
	    <LI><P>Using the <CODE>system</CODE> function is not allowed,
	      as it just invokes the system's <KBD>/bin/sh</KBD> shell
	      to do all the work.
	      </P>
	    <LI><P>You may assume command line arguments are separated
	      by whitespace.  Don't do anything special for
	      backslashes, quotes, ampersands or other characters that
	      are ``special'' in other shells. Note that this means
	      commands in your shell will not be able to operate on
	      filenames with spaces in them!
	      </P>
	    <LI><P>You may set a reasonable maximum on the number of
	      command line arguments, but your shell should handle
	      input lines of any length.
	      </P>
	    <LI><P>The executable file for your shell should be named
	      <KBD><font color="RED">w4118_</font>sh</KBD>. When testing, make sure you execute your
	      <KBD><font color="RED">w4118_</font>sh</KBD> and not <KBD>/bin/sh</KBD>.
	      </P>
	</UL>

<LI><P>A few shell commands are not separate programs at all,
	  but are handled directly by the shell program. You have
	  already implemented <KBD>exit</KBD>, which is an example of
	  this. Now implement <KBD>cd</KBD>, the change directory
	  command. You will need to invoke the <CODE>chdir</CODE>
	  system call to do this. Note that if the call to
	  <CODE>chdir</CODE> fails, you probably don't want to exit
	  the shell but instead should handle the error appropriately.
	  </P>

	<LI><P>Some convenient builtins present in many shells are
	  <KBD>pushd</KBD>, <KBD>popd</KBD>, and
	  <KBD>dirs</KBD>. Implement these in your shell.
	  </P>
	<UL>
	    <LI><P><KBD>pushd</KBD> works like <KBD>cd</KBD>, but
	      pushes the directory you switched from onto a stack.
	      </P>
	    <LI><P><KBD>popd</KBD> pops the top directory off the
	      stack, and <KBD>cd</KBD>'s to it.  In other words, a
	      <KBD>pushd</KBD> followed by a <KBD>popd</KBD> should
	      bring you back to the directory you were in before the
	      <KBD>pushd</KBD>. 
	      </P>
	    <LI><P><KBD>dirs</KBD> prints the contents of the stack.
	      </P>
	</UL>

	<LI><P>The <VAR>path</VAR> variable holds a list of possible
	  paths in which to search for executables. The list of paths
	  is empty by default. 
	  You should implement a builtin command to control this
	  variable: <KBD>path [+|- /some/dir]</KBD>
	</P>
	<UL>
	<LI><P> <KBD>path</KBD> (without arguments) displays all the
	  entries in the list separated by colons, 
	  e.g. <VAR>"/bin:/usr/bin"</VAR>.</P>
	<LI><P> <KBD>path + /some/dir</KBD> appends the given
	  pathname to the path list.</P>
	<LI><P> <KBD>path - /some/dir</KBD> removes the given
	  pathname from the path list.</P>

<center><h3>Additional Requirements</h3></center>
<li>All code (including test programs) must be written in C.
</li><li>Make at least ten commits with Git.  The point is to make
  incremental changes and use an iterative development cycle.  
</li><li>Follow the following coding style rules:
<ul>
<li>Tab size: 8 spaces.
<li>Do not have more that 3 levels of indentations (unless the
    function is extremely simple).
<li>Do not have lines that goes after the 80th column (with rare
    exceptions).
<li>Do not comment your code to say obvious things. Use /* ... */
    and not // ...
<li>Follow 
  the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle">Linux
    kernel coding style</a>.
  Use <a href="https://github.com/mirrors/linux-2.6/blob/master/scripts/checkpatch.pl">checkpatch</a>, a script which checks coding style rules.
</ul>
</li><li>Use a makefile to control the compilation of your code.  The makefile should have at least a default target that builds all assigned programs. 
</li><li>When using <tt>gcc</tt> to compile your code, use the <tt>-Wall</tt> switch to ensure that all warnings are displayed.  <b>Do not</b> be satisfied with code that merely compiles; it should compile with no warnings.  You will lose points if your code produces warnings when compiled.
</li><li>Check the return values of all functions utilizing system resources.  Do not blithely assume all requests for memory will succeed and all writes to a file will occur correctly.  Your code should handle errors properly.  Many failed function calls should not be fatal to a program.  Typically, a system call will return <tt>-1</tt> in the case of an error (<tt>malloc</tt> will return <tt>NULL</tt>).  
If a function call sets the <code>errno</code> variable (see the function's man page to find out if it does), you should use the result of <code>strerror(errno)</code> as part of your error message.
As far as system calls are concerned, you will want to use one of the
mechanisms described in <a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/C/node18.html#SECTION001810000000000000000">Reporting Errors</a> or <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_mono/libc.html#Error%20Reporting">Error Reporting</a>. 
</li></ol>

<ol><center><h3>Tips</h3></center>
<li>For this assignment, your primary reference will be <a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/C/CE.html">Programming in C</a>.  You might also find the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/">Glibc Manual</a> useful.
</li><li>Many questions about functions and system behaviour can be found in the system manual pages; type in <tt>man</tt> <i>function</i> to get more information about <i>function</i>.  If <i>function</i> is a system call, <tt>man 2</tt> <i>function</i> can ensure that you receive the correct man page, rather than one for a system utility of the same name.
</li><li>If you are having trouble with basic Unix/Linux behavior, you might want to check out the resources section of the class webpage.
</li><li>A lot of your problems have happened to other people.  If you have a strange error message, you might want to try searching for the message on <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>.
