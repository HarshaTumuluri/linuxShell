Description
------------

1) shell.c - This is the main program which accepts user input from the command line, interprets it and passes it to varioius functions within this file which execute the give command. Shell commands like cd, dirs, pushd, popd are handled by different functions. 

2) shell.h - Header file containing function prototypes.

3) linkedlist.c - provides linked list functionality to adding, removing directories into the path variable. 

4) linkedlist.h - header file for linkedlist.c which contains function prototypes.

5) stack.c - provides stack functionality which is required for commands like pushd and popd

6) stack.h - header file for stack.c which contains function prototypes.

7) util.c - provides utility functions such as tokenize the input command, find length of the tokenized input command.

8) util.h - header file for util.c

9) Makefile - to compile the dependencies of shell.c file


How the commands work / Expected behaviour / Assumptions
--------------------------------------------------------

Note 1: I have implemented the commands like "cd, pushd, popd, dirs" in such a way that they behave exactly similar to how they behave in the linux shell. 

Note 2: Please use the "path" command to set the directories in path variable before you fire any commands. Or else it will diaplay an error message like "Error: BAD ADDRESS"

1) The input command can be as long as the user wants. However, the shell will truncate the use input at 8192 characters (BUFSIZ) and proceed with the executing of the command. The reason for taking this approach is commands cannot be as long as BUFSIZ. And reading the whole use input to the program will use up all the RAM unnecessarily. 

The limit on the number of arguments (words seprated by spaces) in the input command is 200. If this limit is crossed, the shell prints an error message saying that the number of arguments cannot be more than 200 and asks the user to input a command again. 

2) The behaviour of the cd in "MYSHELL" is same as the linux shell. 
  "cd /bin" will change the current directory to /bin 
  And, "cd /bin /usr" will also work! and will change the current working directory to /bin. This behaviour is similar to the linux shell. 

3) "dirs" will print the director stack and always the current working dir is on top of this stack. "dirs" takes no arguments, it displays an error message if arguments are provided to this command. 

4) "pushd" without arguments will work and interchange the top two elements of the directory stack (which can be viewed by "dirs"). If the directory stack has only one directory (current directory), this command prints an message saying that there is no other directory. 

The "pushd" command behaves in a similar way in the linux shell.


5) "path [+/-] /some/dir" does not check if the input directory name is a valid one or not. path takes only one directory name, if multiple directories are provided to path variable in a single go it will print an error message displaying the proper usage of path. 


Sample Run
-----------

harsha@insomniac:~/gitExperiments/hmwk1/shell$ ./w4118_sh 

Note: Please set path variable using "path" command before issuing commands. Path is empty by default
